<!-- Thanks for learning about sustainability at Pitt. , where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are exploring sustainable design, gather pictures and data you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the zip file from GitHub. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you can find them and organize assets like files and images. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "CodePad" on Chromebooks. Open the index.html document in the text editor and we can get started building our own webpage.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML code comments be, or delete them.-->

<!--First, we'll need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website works. You can keep the title of this HTML document, "My Nature Outing," or change it to whatever you want to call it. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

<!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->

      <p style="color:black"><p>The bike cave is an area where collage students have an area to help reair bikes, also they give new ones. This can be done for almost no price or for free. You can bring in a bike that needs repairs and they will give you the tools and all to repair it. If you dont know how to fix your bike they will help instruct you. Now if you dont need to repair it they also give bike modifications. This idea and current running shop is important because students and local yinzers can get free repairs to help take down the useage of cars in pittsburgh. This idea could be spread to other locations to lower air polution and help locals who need their bikes.</p>

    <p style="color:black"><p>Rain gaurdens are drains and spouts that provide food and shelter for wildlife.It also gives more of the water that rains to the trees and plants instead of just letting it waste away. The way it works is that it pulls the water that rained underground and through pipes it will go into the area where the plants are. This is important because it will save water to go to the plants that we use for things like cereal. These could be useful anywhere in the world.</p>
